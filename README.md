# Greeting_identifier
This package contains trained NLP models for identifying the presence of a greeting in a sentence. The two models are WE (a baseline model that make prediction from a gloVec word embeddings) and unidirectional RNN with LSTM. As expected the RNN model outperforms the baseline model. Overall, the models performance is tied to the training dataset. Most of the positive training examples contain the greeting at the beginning of the sentences. Feel free to repurpose the code to solve other language prediction problem. In fact, with a one-hot and a softmax activation implementation, this code can make predict for multiple classes. The dataset used for training the models was downloaded from https://nextit-public.s3-us-west-2.amazonaws.com/. The GloVec word embeddings was downloaded from https://github.com/uclnlp/inferbeddings/tree/master/data/glove. For more accurate results, download/clone and run from your local machine. Comments/suggestions are welcome.
